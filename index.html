    <h1>Hi, I’m Karina.</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>I’m a designer specializing in research and interaction design for consumer products, currently working at Apple.</p>
    <p>I entered the design world in 2019 after realizing a career in international development wasn't for me. In college, I studied Political Science and spent the first few years of my working life focused on effective altruism and foreign direct investment. I realized what I loved most about development work was learning from end users, and I realized I was good at it. I began to see the parallels with user research in the product design world.</p>

    <p>In the time since, I’ve come to identify with much more than the research side of design. Moving into this field tapped into artistic and creative interests I’ve had (and pushed aside) all my life, and I’m thrilled to be building on those through my work.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I’m passionate about interior design, hiking, climbing and cooking⁄baking for friends and family.</p>
